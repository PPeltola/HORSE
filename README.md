# HORSE

I will add all my currently local files here when I have cleaned the project to be presentable. Data will not be available here due to file size limitations. The ``src`` folder has a lot of scripts I used for data scraping and processing, they are all almost completely undocumented, so I wouldn't waste time reading their contents. What matters is the final data they are used to obtain and construct.
